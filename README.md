 # List of Implemented features

1. FCM notifications

Note: Leaves wouldn't be required in this case as money is deducted only if user spends in the mess.

# List of known bugs

1. The mess tile in applications list still stays even if all the applications are taken care of (Though it will say the number of applicants from this mess is zero).

# Operating System used - Windows
Though I don't use any software for UI/UX, I like to keep my UI clean and minimal.
